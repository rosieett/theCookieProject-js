# theCookieProject-js

This project using javascript will dynamically load cookie recipe data that I've distilled from J. Kenji Alt Lopez's serious eats article The Food Lab's Chocolate Chip Cookies Recipe. It's currently a working project but the goal is to create a page so a user can insert their ideal cookie preferences and the tool will spit out what to change in a recipe but also a recipe that meets the users needs.
